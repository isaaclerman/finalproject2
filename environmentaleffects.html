Evnvironmental Effects
<br>
<div class="environment"><p>The environmental effects of global warming has taken a major toll on our planet. According to National Geographic, "Global Warming sea levels are rising 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year, and the 
rise is occuring at a faster rate in recent years." This is the result of Greenland's and Antartica's ice glaicers melting due to global warming. From the exhaust in our cars to the planes in the sky,
global warming has been contributing to mother nature's demise.</p></div>
